====================

Solution code for IBM Research "ponder this" challenge, Nov 2013

I am not 100% ready to submit this solution at the moment, as I have not
taken a sufficient stab at the case for "4 or more cubes".

The case for 3 cubes fell easily to simply Python hacking and
brute-force search.
